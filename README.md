Kta Old HomePage code

## Overview
#### This is the old homepage of KTA(https://kta40thx.wordpress.com).
#### So now this isn't runnning anywhere.
#### This site is based by The CMS - Mezzanine(made by django).
#### And I have custamized for this site like mezzanine_tags or templates or original app (ex: member, planning, footer, gallery and so on.)
####The only function of "blog" is no change from Mezzanine because it is very good function for me.

## Constitution
#### Each One page has one function. (All page have same "footer". Only "footer" is common function.)
#### index.html
+ intro.html
+ member
+ planning
+ galleries
+ blog

## Requirement
+ Python 3.5
+ Django 1.9.0
+ Mezzanine 4.1.0
